Once I got the domains working, I learned a few things:

Use variable time step





Then cd into the WRFV3 directory and issue a 

./clean -a
./configure -hyb [24]
./compile -j 4 em_real >& log.compile [-j 4 compiles in parallel]

Now copy the geo_em files into the correct WPS directories...

ln -s the met_em files into the run directory
[Note:  the real.exe program didn't work, so I had to:
./clean -a
./configure -hyb
./compile (this time without -j 4, perhaps this is the issue)

Then it all worked...
