geogrid.exe only works if you change the topo file directory from:
/glade/p/work/...
to
/glade/work/...


Since these are only 24-hour runs, you can open up an interactive job and just run the model from there:
qsub -I -l select=4:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=36 -l walltime=02:00:00 -q regular -A UCLA0022

Then run:
mpiexec_mpt ./real.exe >& log.real
mpiexec_mpt ./wrf.exe >& log.wrf
