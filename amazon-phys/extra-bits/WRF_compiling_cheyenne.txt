(DO NOT use same compiler, 15)
USE 24, this is the one they use in the Cheyenne intro slides

needed to add "module load netcdf" to my .profile

for WPS ./configure (option 23)

IF IT CAN'T FIND libpthread_nonshared.a you may need to point to where the UNGRIB libraries are
then make sure the configure.wps

COMPRESSION_LIBS = -L/${DIR}/UNGRIB_LIBRARIES/lib –ljasper –lpng –lz
COMPRESSION_INC	= -I/${DIR}/UNGRIB_LIBRARIES/include	







NESTED RUN

make directory, tar xvfz the directories

cd into WRFV3
./configure -hyb [option 24 - INTEL SGI MPT]

chose option 23 for WPS ./configure
