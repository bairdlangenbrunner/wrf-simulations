TO COMPILE CORRECTLY YOU MUST USE THE ABOVE

/glade/apps/opt/netcdf/4.3.0/intel/12.1.5

retrying everything

./clean -a in wrf
./configure -hyb (OPTION 28 WORKS ON YELLOWSTONE) -- actually trying 15 now
CHANGE THE CLM PCO2 VALUES NOW BEFORE COMPILING
use bsub < bsub_compile.sh (seeing if compiling in parallel works)

The key is that you ./clean -a wrf stuff, then ./configure, then change phys parameterizations
THEN you can compile

Tried recycling all WPS stuff from before.  Seeing if it worked...

real.exe didn't work well just yet - seemed to be trying to start on 1993??
trying to re-run metgrid.exe first, and then real.exe, to see if metgrid.exe affects where real.exe starts...

worked, genuinely don't know why





NOW TRYING TO RUN WRF_400 from the info (GRIBFILES, FILE:s, and met_em files) in WRF (orig: 1000)
